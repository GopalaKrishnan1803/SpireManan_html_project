                <h2>Store Details:</h2>
                <p>In our own distinct and imaginative way we are bringing back the Ombre style of dyeing. Our specially curated collection for the Menswear by Manan segment focuses on this varied craft also known as dip dyeing. This ethereal fabric is created after days of brainstorming and working with craftsmen who help us bring our vision to life with their skill. The Ombre technique focuses on laboriously hand dipping fabric in colored solutions, which then emerge as subtle gradations from top to bottom. Itâ€™s an art that is perfected with time and strenuous experimentation, which makes Menswear by Manan all the more special and timeless.</p>
